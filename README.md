## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

App 1: Apple Clock App
    Able to run even when remove from background
    Clock animation is nice
App 2: Discord
    Live Chat
    Easy to share and live talk
App 3: Apple Weather App
    Live weather information
    Beautiful background
    
I want to build a live chat application, where user can join a room and text each other. User can create whatever topic they want to see, and join any conversation.

## Notes

Connecting the button from view to the View Controller is quite strange, not used to drag a UI into a text file. Swift is not beginer friendly.
